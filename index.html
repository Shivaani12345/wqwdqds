        <p>Dear friends and well wishers,
St Joseph’s Convent Higher Secondary School, Tezpur, was established in the year 1936. In its long journey of nearly 85 years, it has grown today into a mighty tree. But not a few were the hurdles and struggles that it underwent in the course of its passage from inception to date. God’s guiding hand, however, never failed and the hard toil and pain of the handful missionaries today bore abundant fruits. Many generations of students did pass through the portals of this noble institution; and among them are numerous eminent women of high standing in all walks of life, in our society. May God Almighty be blessed!
The goal of the school had been and will always be, to impart value education through the academic syllabus and co-curricular activities that brings about integral development and holistic growth in every child. Children are precious gifts of God; they are entrusted to us to be moulded and formed in the best of their ability and capacity. Our mission is to unfold the rich potentials and hidden talents to the maximum. True to its motto VIRTUE AND KNOWLEDGE, the ultimate aim of the educational endeavours of our Institution is directed to forming young minds into intellectually enlightened, emotionally balanced, and morally upright citizens, which in turn will bring about social transformation and catalysts of change in today’s India.
Times have changed and the extremely fast growing phenomenon of science and technology of communication make all the more our educational institution challenging and difficult. The digital world compels us to keep in pace with the rest of the world. Our wish therefore, is to inaugurate and initiate the maximum possibility of letting our children enjoy the information technology through the school Website
The Website will be a forum for the school to continue its aim and goal as stated above, the holistic formation of the young. This is a process which entails the full collaboration and cooperation of everyone; in other words, the synergy of the Management, Staff, Parents and Students. The school will continue to make its students rise and shine, while grooming them to become good human beings and honest citizens. The website is the long cherished dream of many. May it offer an enviable chance and ample opportunities for the past students to get connected with one another and have a glimpse of their Alma Mater.
Welcome to everyone associated with St. Joseph’s Convent Higher Secondary School, Tezpur. Log on to our website and relive your exciting school days. Do not forget your innovative ideas and creative contribution to keep the Website going and growing.
God bless you all!
With all good wishes,
Sr. Emilia Chopfohra, FMA
Principal</p>
